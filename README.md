# Getting Started with OpenCV and it's usage in images

> This notebook has two main objectives:

    1. Getting familiar with OpenCV - its installation and some of its basic usage.
    
    2. Looking at the data we will use - this will give you a lot of context for my future projects.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

OpenCV is a hugely popular image processing library. It is used in a number of image processing applications. A lot of the backend processing of OpenCV is done in C++, which makes it very fast.

- What is the background of your project?

In this notebook, we are attempting to install OpenCV and gettin familiar with it's usage on images.

- Business Problem Statement:

We will be installing OpenCV, importing it and working with Images with OpenCV.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The dataset is an image.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We could install OpenCV, import it and use it on images.
